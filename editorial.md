# Editorial Policy

PSYPOL/NEWS is a daily bulletin published by Psychopolitica. It curates stories where the machinery of reality construction becomes visible.

## How It Works

The initial scan is performed by Claude Code (Anthropic), which reads approximately 300 items daily from RSS feeds and proposes a shortlist. Every final decision, what makes the cut, what gets rejected, how headlines are written, is made by [Nikita Petrov](https://psychopolitica.com). The filter improves over time: each yes/no decision teaches the system what Psychopolitica considers worth paying attention to.

## Sources

Each day, the following feeds are scanned:

- **Google News** — Top Stories, World, Science, and Technology sections (~230 items)
- **Meduza** — Independent Russian-language journalism
- **Ars Technica** — Deep technology and science reporting
- **Rest of World** — Technology and its consequences outside the Western bubble
- **Atlas Obscura** — The genuinely strange
- **Wired** — Technology, science, and culture at the edge
- **404 Media** — Independent tech journalism, the digital underbelly
- **Nature** — Primary science research
- **New Scientist** — Science, technology, and their human implications
- **Futurism** — Emerging technology and the future as it arrives

When a story in these feeds is a retelling of reporting from another outlet, we link to the original source. Paywalled originals are linked through archive.ph when possible.

## The Filter

We are looking for:

- Stories where the mechanics of power, reality construction, or social control become visible, even briefly
- Reality glitches: AI content passing as real, deepfakes with consequences, information operations caught in progress, the boundary between real and fabricated shifting
- The agency question: surveillance, algorithmic control, behavioral manipulation, and its inverse — people finding autonomy or building outside the system
- Power caught without its story straight: propaganda mid-operation, corporate capture documented, state violence before the framing arrives
- The absurdist angle: machinery visible and failing, or contradicting itself
- Things that read like science fiction but are happening: biotech, neurotech, consciousness research, anything that shifts what "human" means
- Russia as a place where these dynamics run faster and more visibly
- Fringe going mainstream: psychedelics in clinical settings, esoteric practices getting institutional backing, forbidden ideas becoming respectable
- The global south drawn into dynamics that rarely get covered: the human supply chains of conflict, power reshaped by technology in places most outlets ignore
- People under extreme constraint revealing something about what humans are

We are not looking for:

- Standard breaking news with no deeper angle
- Stories that fit cleanly into left/right framing
- Tech hype or doom without the deeper element
- Celebrity, sports, or markets, unless something genuinely strange is happening
- Outrage bait

## Structure

**TODAY** contains stories from the current day's feeds. **THIS WEEK** collects the strongest stories from earlier in the week. Both sections carry between 5 and 20 stories depending on how much interesting material has surfaced. THIS WEEK resets each Monday.

Headlines are rewritten to be descriptive enough that a reader gets the story without clicking.
